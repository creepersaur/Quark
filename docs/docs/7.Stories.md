# Stories

For all those who don't know what a story is:

> Stories are ModuleScripts that ends with .story in their name.

They're really good for prototyping UI elements and quickly creating reactive UI.
For showing stories, you need to have a storybook plugin.
My Favorite is [UI Labs](https://pepeeltoro41.github.io/ui-labs/).

## Creating stories

Make a `test.story` ModuleScript in StarterGui. This should show up in your story plugin on the left (usually).

A story is a function, which has a `parent` parameter. It also takes a cleanup function to destroy all the UI elements that were made when closing the story.
This is how stories generally look:

```lua
return function(parent: Instance)
    -- UI STUFF HERE

    return function()
        -- CLEANUP
    end
end
```

## Stories with Quark

Use Quark to create a story and set the `Parent` property to the parent parameter.

```lua
local Quark = require(ReplicatedStorage.Quark)
local New = Quark.New

return function(parent: Instance)
    local Main = New "Frame" {
        Parent = parent,
        Size = UDim2.fromOffset(100, 100)
    }

    -- Cleanup everything that was made
    return Quark.Cleanup
end
```

## Cleanup

`Quark.Cleanup` is a function used by Quark to destroy everything when the story is cleaned up. (It also disconnects all script connections made by Quark.)

You can also destroy everything in a story by yourself, but Quark does this for you and destroys almost everything too. (You can still write a function which uses `Cleanup()` if you want more control.)

## Advanced Stories

Advanced stories are used for parameters and custom features that UI Labs (or plugin of choice) might give. This all depends on the plugin, but I suggest reading up on how to make stuff like this on their [Documentation](https://pepeeltoro41.github.io/ui-labs/docs/stories/advanced/generic.html). (Quark uses what UI Labs calls generic stories.)

Here's just a simple advanced story:

```lua
local Quark = require(game.ReplicatedStorage.Quark)
local New = Quark.New

return {
    controls = nil, -- Add controls
    render = function(props) -- the main story function (like before)
        local parent = props.target -- the parent is now `props.target`

        -- UI stuff

        return Quark.Cleanup -- CLEANUP
    end
}
```

# Examples

There are many examples given in the [examples](../src/examples/) folder.
